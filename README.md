# Transfer Learning with Hybrid Models

Welcome to this repository which contains code for transfer learning using hybrid models. Transfer learning is a technique in which a model trained on one task is re-purposed on a second related task. This can be particularly useful when there is a shortage of labeled data for the target task, as the model can leverage its knowledge from the source task. The target application is the chemical process industry (CPI) where unpredictable changes in input or market demands force plants to operate out of normal processing conditions (NOC), rendering previous trained models obsolete.

In this repository, we use hybrid machine learning models which combine the strengths of multiple model types. These models can be more accurate than a single model type, as they can learn complementary features from the different model types.
